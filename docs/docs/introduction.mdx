## What

**Angular Three (NGT)** is an [Angular](https://angular.io) wrapper for [THREE.js](https://threejs.org). This project is inspired by [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

Different from **React Three Fiber** which is a **Renderer**, **NGT** is a wrapper because it wraps **THREE.js** classes in **Directives** to take advantage of **Angular** template and other **Angular** features.

## Why

Utilizing Template-less **Directives** to build 3D scenes declaratively with accessing to **Angular** Dependency Injection, Inputs, Outputs, and other common **Directives** while keeping the DOM clean.

## How

**NGT** relies heavily on
[Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection)
to allow for declarative creation of **THREE.js** objects on the
template. Take a look at the following example:

We will explore what each of the element here means in later sections.
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ng"
  values={[
    {label: 'Angular', value: 'ng'},
    {label: 'THREE.js', value: 'three'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value={'ng'}>

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <ngt-canvas>
      // highlight-start
      <ngt-mesh>
        <ngt-box-geometry></ngt-box-geometry>
        <ngt-mesh-basic-material
          [parameters]="{ color: 'red' }"
        ></ngt-mesh-basic-material>
      </ngt-mesh>
      // highlight-end
    </ngt-canvas>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={'three'}>

```ts
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  75,
  window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
  0.1,
  1000
);

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// highlight-start
const geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'red' });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
// highlight-end

camera.position.z = 5;

renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Pay attention to the highlighted portion of both snippets, this is where
a `THREE.Mesh` gets instantiated, and added to the `Scene`.

:::info

`THREE.Mesh` is one of the most basic Object type in **THREE.js** that
holds some `Geometry` and `Material` to be displayed on the `Scene`

:::

In the vanilla **THREE.js** version, we instantiate a `Mesh` with a
`BoxBufferGeometry` and `MeshBasicMaterial`. If we were to have another
`Mesh`, we would repeat this step. The flow is `Geometry + Material => Mesh`

Now look at the **Angular** template counterpart, we actually write
`<ngt-mesh>` before we would write `<ngt-box-geometry>` and
`<ngt-mesh-basic-material>`, and we also nest the `Geometry` with
`Material` inside `Mesh`. The flow is different. This is because in
**Angular**, `ngt-mesh` can _query_ for its nested children which we can
leverage this to assign a `Geometry`, and a `Material` to their _parent_
`Mesh`, declaratively on the Template. Then `<ngt-mesh>`, which is right
under `<ngt-canvas>`, gets added to the `Scene` that `<ngt-canvas>`
created _automatically_. This concept is applied throughout **Angular
Three**
