# Installation

## Compatibility Table

Make sure you check the compatibility table before installing the package.

| NGT Package    | 3rd party            | Version   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| all            | `@angular/core`      | `^13.0.0` |
| all            | `rxjs`               | `^7.0.0`  |
| all            | `three`              | `0.137`   |
| soba           | `three-stdlib`       | `~2.6.1`  |
| postprocessing | `postprocessing`     | `~6.24.0` |
| cannon         | `cannon-es`          | `~0.19.0` |
| cannon         | `cannon-es-debugger` | `~1.0.0`  |

## Installation

### Using `ng add`

```shell
ng add @angular-three/schematics
```

If you are using [Nx Dev Tools](https://nx.dev), use the following commands:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @angular-three/schematics
npx nx generate @angular-three/schematics:init
```

The schematic also turns `skipLibCheck` in the root `tsconfig.json` to `true`. This is required for other libraries' usage like: `soba` or `postprocessing` because their dependencies will fail strict type checking.

### Manual

NGT is a collection of packages that provide different areas of THREE.js. To get started, you only need `@angular-three/core` and its `peerDependencies`

```shell
npm install @angular-three/core three@0.137
npm install --save-dev @types/three@0.137
```

> NGT will always try to stay on a version of THREE.js that has the corresponding typing definitions.
> You can try to adjust the `three` version and its type-definition to the latest patch release: `0.137.x`

## Ecosystem

-   `@angular-three/core`: THREE.js core entities. Most of the exports from `THREE` namespace are provided by **core** package.
-   `@angular-three/soba`: A set of helpers, utilities, and extra entities that are complimentary to `@angular-three/core`. Also, **soba** provides THREE.js entities that are from `three/examples/*` via [three-stdlib](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) for better tree-shakability.
-   `@angular-three/postprocessing`: A set of post-processing effects with `EffectComposer` and other effects from [postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing).
-   `@angular-three/cannon`: Physics support for NGT, ported from [React Three Cannon](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon)
