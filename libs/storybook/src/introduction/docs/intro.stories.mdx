## What is Angular Three (NGT)?

**Angular Three** is a **Component Library** that wraps around [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) to provide a declarative approach to building 3D applications using [Angular](https://angular.io/) capabilities.

## Why is it good to use NGT?

NGT allows the consumers to utilize Template-less Directives to build 3D scenes declaratively with access to Angular Dependency Injection, Inputs, Outputs, and other standard features.

## How does NGT work?

NGT relies heavily on [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection) to allow for declarative creation of THREE.js objects on the template. Take a look at the [SimpleCube example](?path=/story/introduction-examples--simple-cube). We will explore in more detail what is happening under the hood.

## What is the difference between NGT and React Three Fiber?

Many points in comparison with R3F, which are listed here, in [Svelte Cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/docs/faqs#how-is-it-different-from-x-react-three-fiber) (a Svelte-based THREE.js library) also applies to NGT.

[React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F) is a **Renderer** that treats THREE.js as native elements. Hence, it does not **wrap** anything, providing a **clean** surface API and future-proof from THREE.js version changes.

On the other hand, NGT is a **Component Library**, which means for almost every THREE.js entity, there is a corresponding entity (whether it is a Component or a Directive) in NGT. The bulk of the entities in NGT is **Single-Component-as-Module** to be best for Tree-shaking. For maintainability, NGT also **generates** most of these entities, which makes it possible to keep up with THREE.js version changes.

Rendering the THREE.js scene is done **outside** of the Angular Zone. In the future, when [Zone-less](https://angular.io/guide/roadmap#leverage-full-framework-capabilities-with-zonejs-opt-out) is available, NGT will be able to provide an even better experience to the consumers.

> Zone-less is available today, but it requires more understanding and a lot of hoops to jump through to get it to work flawlessly.

It is worth noting that R3F heavily inspires NGT. Many of the concepts and features of NGT are ported from R3F.

## What do I need to get started?

NGT requires you to have fundamental understanding of both Angular and THREE.js
