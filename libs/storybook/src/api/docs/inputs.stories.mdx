# Inputs

There are three main types of inputs for NGT objects:

- Constructor Arguments
- Parameters
- Properties

They seem very similar to each other, but they function a little differently.

## Constructor Arguments

NGT exposes an input `[args]` on the objects that have constructor arguments, in the form of an array of arguments. For example:

When we create a `BoxGeometry`, we can pass in constructor arguments to specify the width, height, and depth of the box.

```ts
new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
```

The following in NGT is equivalent to the above:

```html
<ngt-box-geometry [args]="[1, 1, 1]"></ngt-box-geometry>
```

When consulting THREE.js documentation, if an entity accepts multiple constructor arguments, chances are NGT objects will accept the same arguments via `[args]`. Objects with `[args]` will be reconstructed from scratch when the `[args]` change.

## Parameters

NGT exposes an input `[parameters]` on the objects that accept a set of parameters via an options object, in the form of an object of key value pairs. For example:

When we create a `MeshStandardMaterial`, we can pass in parameters to specify the color, roughness, and metalness of the material.

```ts
new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0xffffff,
  roughness: 0.5,
  metalness: 0.5,
});
```

The following in NGT is equivalent to the above:

```html
<ngt-mesh-standard-material
  [parameters]='{ color: "#ffffff", roughness: 0.5, metalness: 0.5 }'
></ngt-mesh-standard-material>
```

When consulting THREE.js documentation, if an entity accepts an options object, chances are NGT objects will accept the same parameters via `[parameters]`. Objects with `[parameters]` will **NOT** be reconstructed from scratch when the `[parameters]` change.

## Properties

Most of the time, `[args]` and `[parameters]` are mutually exclusive. In addition to either one of those two, NGT objects might also accept extra properties. For example:

A `PointLight` accepts constructor arguments, but they are also an `Object3D` which means they carry a `position` and such.

```ts
const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100); // set color, intensity, and distance of a PointLight
pointLight.position.set(2, 2, 2); // set the position of the PointLight
```

The following in NGT is equivalent to the above:

```html
<ngt-ambient-light
  [intensity]="1"
  [position]="[1, 1, 1]"
  color="white"
  [args]="[undefined, undefined, 100]"
></ngt-ambient-light>

<!-- or -->

<ngt-ambient-light
  [position]="[1, 1, 1]"
  [args]='["white", 1, 100]'
></ngt-ambient-light>
```

## Shortcuts properties

We have already seen from the above example that `[position]="[1, 1, 1]"` is equivalent to `position.set(1, 1, 1)`. `[position]` is one _shortcut_ property because NGT will call the `set` method automatically. There are many other shortcuts properties such `color`, `position`, `rotation`, `scale`, `quaternion`, and so on.

One rule of thumb is that if a property has the `set`/`setScalar` method, it will be called with the value.
