# Stores

NGT makes use of [@rx-angular/state](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular) to provide a way to manage the state of everything happening in the Canvas. These stores are provided by the `ngt-canvas` component and are available to all children of `ngt-canvas` via [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection)

Even though we want to avoid Imperative State Management, it is almost unavoidable such problem when working with an imperative library like THREE.js. Hence, all the stores in NGT expose `get()` method that can retrieve the state at the time of invoking. This is especially helpful when registering animation callbacks. Since animation callbacks are invoked on every frame, `get()` will almost always guarantee to return the latest and freshest state.

## `NgtStore`

This store is the main store for the Canvas. It is responsible for keeping the Renderer, Scene, Camera, and other states/configurations for the 3 main building blocks. It also contains information about the Viewport like Size and Device Pixel Ratio (DPR).

## `NgtAnimationFrameStore`

This store keeps track of all the animation callbacks that are registered. Animations are registered via two ways:

- `(animateReady)` Output
- `NgtAnimationFrameStore#register`

The difference between the two is that the former subscribes a single object to the Animation Frame.

```html
<ngt-mesh (animateReady)="onThisMeshAnimate()"></ngt-mesh>
<ngt-mesh (animateReady)="onThatMeshAnimate()"></ngt-mesh>
```

Some time, it works well. But when you need to orchestrate both meshes through each frame, you cannot use `(animateReady)`. Instead, you can inject `NgtAnimationFrameStore` and call the `register()` method.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'two-meshes',
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh #meshOne></ngt-mesh>
    <ngt-mesh #meshTwo></ngt-mesh>
  `,
})
export class TwoMeshesComponent {
  @ViewChild('meshOne') meshOne: NgtMesh;
  @ViewChild('meshTwo') meshTwo: NgtMesh;

  private animationUuid?: string;

  constructor(private animationFrameStore: NgtAnimationFrameStore) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.animationUuid = this.animationFrameStore.register({
      callback: () => {
        this.meshOne.mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
        this.meshTwo.mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
      },
    });
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.animationFrameStore.unregister(this.animationUuid);
  }
}
```

`NgtAnimationFrameStore#register` returns a `string` UUID which we can use to `unregister` the animation callback.

## `NgtEventsStore`

This store handles the Events inside the Canvas with `Raycaster` and `Intersection` objects. This store is internal, but it is exposed to the consumers. We should never have a need to use this store directly.

## `NgtPerformanceStore`

TBD. Examples needed before explaining.
