```

- `packages/` contains the core libraries and their dependencies
  - `core`: contains the core library. This library holds almost all core entities from THREE.js (anything you can import from `THREE` with `import * as THREE from 'three'`)
    - `core-plugin-e2e`: contains the e2e test for Generators
  - `cannon`: contains the Cannon.js physics engine wrapper. This library exposes directives to work convert 3D objects to Cannon.js shapes and be aware of the physics environment. Uses `cannon-es` and `cannon-es-debugger`
  - `soba`: contains additional helpers and utilities directives/components. This library is mainly ported from [React Three Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-drei)
  - `postprocessing`: contains `EffectComposer` and other effects from `[postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing)`
  - `demo`: an Angular application to quickly test out things. This application also serves as Examples section for our Storybook documentations
  - `storybook`: Angular Three documentations
- `tools/` contains all generators to generate what can be generated from core `THREE` at the moment. They are very similar to each other, browse around, and ask questions if you need help.

If a file has `// GENERATED` at the top, then do not touch it. Instead, fix the generator instead.

The generators are using [Nx Devkit](https://nx.dev/l/r/core-concepts/nx-devkit).
