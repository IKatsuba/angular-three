## What is Angular Three (NGT)?

**Angular Three** is a **Component Library** that wraps around [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) to provide a declarative approach to building 3D applications using [Angular](https://angular.io/) capabilities.

## Why is it good to use NGT?

Utilizing Template-less Directives to build 3D scenes declaratively with accessing to Angular Dependency Injection, Inputs, Outputs, and other common Directives while keeping the DOM clean.

## How does NGT work?

NGT relies heavily on [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection) to allow for declarative creation of THREE.js objects on the template. Take a look at the [SimpleCube example](?path=/story/introduction-examples--simple-cube). We will explore in more detailed what is happening under the hood.

## What is the difference between NGT and React Three Fiber?

Many points in comparison with R3F listed here in [Svelte Cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/docs/faqs#how-is-it-different-from-x-react-three-fiber) (a Svelte-based THREE.js library) also applies to NGT.

[React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F) is a **Renderer** that treats THREE.js as native elements. Hence, it does not **wrap** anything, providing a **clean** surface API, and future-proof from THREE.js version changes.

On the other hand, NGT is a **Component Library** which means for almost each THREE.js entity, there is a corresponding entity (whether it is a Component or a Directive) in NGT. The bulk of the entities in NGT are **Single-Component-as-Module** to be best for Tree-shaking. For maintainability, NGT also **generates** most of these entities which makes it possible to keep up with THREE.js version changes.

Rendering the THREE.js scene is done **outside** of the Angular Zone. In the future when [Zone-less](https://angular.io/guide/roadmap#leverage-full-framework-capabilities-with-zonejs-opt-out) is available, NGT will be able to provide even better experience to the consumers.

> Zone-less is actually available today, but it requires more understanding and a lot of hoops to jump through to get it to work flawlessly.

It is worth noting that NGT is heavily inspired by R3F. Many of the concepts and features of NGT are ported from R3F.

## Before we start

- Understand the fundamentals of Angular and THREE.js. Consult [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/docs) and [THREE.js Docs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html) for more information.
